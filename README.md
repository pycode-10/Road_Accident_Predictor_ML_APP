# Road_Accident_Predictor_ML_APP

## Overview

This project involves the development of a machine learning application that predicts the probability of a vehicle being involved in an accident based on various parameters.

## Key Features

- **Prediction Parameters:**  
  - Time of day  
  - Weather conditions  
  - Driver's sobriety  
  - Reckless driving  
  - Driver distractions  
  - Speeding  

- **Machine Learning Models Used:**  
  - Linear Regression  
  - Decision Trees  
  - Random Forest  
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
  - Gradient Boosting  

## Repository Contents

1. **Project.ipynb**:  
   - Code for building the models from scratch.  
   - Includes data analysis, data visualization, and data manipulation.  
   - Construction of multiple ML models.

2. **app.py**:  
   - Code for the user interface.  
   - Built the User Interface using Streamlit, allowing the user to input the data and recieve predictions.

3. **Saved Models**:  
   - Six files containing the saved models.

4. **Outout Folder**:
   - Contains images of the user interface.
   - `UI_image_1.jpg`: Screenshot of the main input form.
   - `UI_image_2.jpg`: Screenshot of the prediction result.
